# CaBi-Bikeshare-Prediction
ML Ops 2024 Final Project 


# Problem Statement(s)

Utilizing [Capital Bikeshare Data Trip History Dataset](https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data), I seek to determine the following: 

1. Duration and frequency of trips based on `Member Types` 
2. How holidays, seasons, work-week vs weekend use, and daily/weekly weather affect bikeshare utilization 
3. How the distribution of member type varies across D.C. neighborhoods 
4. Based on the member type by neighborhood, also where destinations tend to go based on weekday and weekend trips 
5. What stations in D.C. tend to have the highest rates of undocked bikes

This will all culminate on a model that predicts trip duration or which exit stations tend to have the highest rates of non-station parked bikes.
